## Lab 3.5 - Assign privileged account to Restricted Management Administrative Unit (RMAU)

1. Create an [Administrative Unit with dynamic membership](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/admin-units-members-dynamic?tabs=admin-center#add-rules-for-dynamic-membership-groups) named “Privileged Users” and enable “[Restricted management administrative unit](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/admin-units-restricted-management)” during the creation process.

2. Configure a rule depending on your naming convention for privileged users or other unique attributes (e.g., domain suffix for cloud-only accounts).

    > 💡 **Optional**  
    > Evaluate the option to configure [dynamic membership with the memberOf attribute](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/users/groups-dynamic-rule-member-of). This allows you to assign members of role-assignable groups or other privileged groups to RMAU automatically. Consider that this feature is in preview and take note of the warning about limitations from the [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/users/groups-dynamic-rule-member-of) documentation.

3. Assign a role [on the scope of the Administrative Unit](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/manage-roles-portal?tabs=admin-center#assign-roles-with-administrative-unit-scope-1) to regain access for managing privileged users. Choose a dedicated role-assignable group which will be used for Control Plane Management.
